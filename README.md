## 🧠 GenAI Health Summary App

This project is a lightweight, AI-powered health assistant that extracts blood test results from scanned medical reports and generates clear, actionable summaries using open-source language models. Designed for speed, clarity, and extensibility, it bridges OCR, prompt engineering, and GenAI to deliver meaningful insights from routine diagnostics.

### 🔍 What It Does

- 📸 **OCR Extraction**: Uses Tesseract to parse blood test values from scanned or photographed lab reports.
- 🧪 **Test Interpretation**: Identifies key biomarkers (e.g., Hemoglobin, Glucose, HbA1c, ALT, Platelets) and flags abnormal values.
- 🤖 **GenAI Summarization**: Generates short, understandable health summaries using models like `flan-t5-base`, optimized for natural-language output.
- ⚡ **Fast & Extensible**: Built with modular components for easy model swapping, fallback logic, and future expansion (e.g., cholesterol, vitamin D).

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python (core logic)
- Tesseract OCR (image-to-text)
- Hugging Face Transformers (LLM integration)
- Pandas (data handling)
- Streamlit (optional UI layer)

### 💡 Why It Matters

Blood reports are often dense and hard to interpret. This app empowers users with instant, personalized summaries — making health data more accessible and actionable. It’s especially useful for:

- Patients tracking chronic conditions
- Health tech startups building GenAI features
- Developers exploring LLMs in real-world workflows

### 🚀 How to Use

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Upload a blood report image and receive a summary like:

> Hemoglobin is low, suggesting mild anemia. Glucose and HbA1c are elevated, indicating prediabetes. ALT is high, suggesting liver stress. Platelets are slightly elevated. Consider dietary changes and follow-up with a doctor.
